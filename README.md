# EXPERIMENT 5: C++ Decision Making Statements

## Aim
- To study and implement decision making statements in C++.
- To understand the use of conditional logic to control program flow based on specific conditions.

## Apparatus
- Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)

## Theory

### Decision Making in C++
Decision making statements are used to control the flow of a program by executing different blocks of code depending on certain conditions. These statements evaluate logical expressions and decide which code should run.

C++ provides the following decision making statements:
- `if` statement
- `if...else` statement
- `else if` ladder
- `nested if` statements
- `switch` statement

These structures are essential for writing dynamic and responsive programs.

## Functions

- Use `if` and `if...else` to perform basic conditional checks.
- Apply `else if` and nested conditions to handle multiple cases.
- Use the `switch` statement for cleaner control flow in multi-option scenarios.
- Understand and apply comparison operators in conditions.
- Accept user input and perform operations based on the input values.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how to implement decision making statements in C++ using `if`, `else`, and `switch`. I understood how conditions are evaluated and how they influence the execution of specific code blocks. This experiment helped me build logic-based programs that react to different inputs and conditions.
